This is meeting-scheduler, a Web application for figuring out what time
a meeting is in multiple timezones.

I'm initially developing it to be useful to the Mozilla community, but
with an eye towards letting it become more customizable in the future.

It requires that the compiled copy of tz.js (or, on an HTTP server,
tz.js.gz) from https://github.com/dbaron/tz.js be placed in this
directory along with the code.
